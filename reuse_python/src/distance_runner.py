Athlete Reusability Project

This project demonstrates different ways to reuse classes in Python:
- Inheritance
- Composition
- Composition through interface implementation

Classes:
    Athlete: Represents an athlete with a specific specialty.
    Sprinter: Represents a sprinter, inheriting from Athlete.
    Thrower: Represents a thrower, utilizing Athlete class through composition.
    AthleteInterface: Interface defining the method for athlete specialty.
    AthleteBase: Class implementing the AthleteInterface.
    DistanceRunner: Represents a distance runner, using Athlete interface through composition.
    Jumper: Represents a jumper, using Athlete interface through composition.

Usage:
    Import the required classes and create instances of different types of athletes.
    Each athlete instance can display information about themselves using the `display()` method.
